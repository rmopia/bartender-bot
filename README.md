# bartender-bot
Itching for the Wild West? Thirsty for a whiskey? Have some whiskey as dry as this chat bot.

Synopsis
========
The purpose of this project was to create a basic chat bot (with a persona of a bartender) in python with various APIs being utilized. This was purely a personal and educational pursuit. The first version uses the nltk API and is rather straightforward. The second version is a little more complex as, on top nltk, it makes use of tensorflow and a json file as the corpus or guideline.
